# Space Shooter Game

A simple space shooter game built with Python and Pygame. Control your spaceship, dodge enemy ships, and shoot them down to earn points. 

**Note:** This project was created as a learning exercise to familiarize myself with the Pygame module and basic game development concepts.

## Features

- **Player spaceship**: Navigate and shoot using simple controls.
- **Enemy spaceships**: Randomly appearing enemies.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You also need the Pygame library to run this game. Install it using:

```bash
pip install pygame
